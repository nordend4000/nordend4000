Hi there, I'm Romain GIOUX an inspired self-taught
Web Developer based in Zurich, Switzerland.

I love discovering new technologies and Solving Digital Puzzles.
Aiming for a career reconversion, since the last 2 years,  
I didn't stop to learn how the Web is Built and how I can contribute 
to make it a pleasant space.
    
My challenge is to turn this enthusiasm and commitment into a
professional activity, gain experiences by
creating complex projects and join an ambitious team.
